# Example ESP-IDP Project Nix Flake

Example ESP32 project which flashes an LED.

This is mostly a learning exercise to help me master the Nix programming language.

## Building and developing

    nix develop

    idf.py flash

Should work with VSCode if you have `direnv` installed and the matching plugin.
